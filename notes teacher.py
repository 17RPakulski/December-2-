checkwin() - 1) if one player has 21 and others don't that player wins
                else if more than one player has 21 its a tie m oney is returned
                else if some players have more than 21 they are bust
                
stand() - no change to hands

hit() - an extra card is dealt so call give card with number of cards and player name
